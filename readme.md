# Sand

> :warning: Notice: School started around two months ago, which is why not much progress has been made. Also, if someone is very good with either Renderware, gamedev, or Minecraft modding please message me on Discord. Again, sorry for the low amount of progress.

Sand is a Minecraft mod that aims to import the GTA San Andreas world into Minecraft.  

# Status

This mod is currently in its infancy stage. DFF loading is mostly completed (at least for player models), TXD loading is completed, and IMG extraction has not been attempted. As for the Minecraft side (not committed), dff model is rendered via Minecraft's VertexBuilder, but due to no skeletal rendering system in Forge, animations are not implemented.
